These docs provide additional insight towards [VMchooser](https://aka.ms/vmchooser) and how to use it.

In the menu above you can find a section per VMchooser module ;

2. **DiskChooser** : Want to know what the most cost efficient disk layout there is for your given set of specifications? 
3. **BulkUploader** : Where VMchooser & DiskChooser are focused on a single search. BulkUploader allows you to find the match for 100s, 1000s, ... of Virtual Machine configuration in one go!
4. **VMoptimizer** : When to go for a certain contract type (PAYG vs Reserved Instances)? Or what about the windows license, does it make sense to go PAYG or is it more interesting to buy a license?
