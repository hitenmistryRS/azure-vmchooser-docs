# How do the filter criteria work?
* If you enter a filter criteria, then it is seen as a requirement! So if you would combine wanting a burstable VM and premium disks, then you will not get any results.
* Sometimes certain criteria are not know for a VM size. For instance, the [GPU Optimized series](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-gpu) do not show any information on IOPS. If you request an IOPS, then these VMs will not be picked up in the results.
